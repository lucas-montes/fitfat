# SCE Atomic Commit

## Purpose

Turn the current staged changes into atomic repository-style commit messages.

Write messages matching:

`references/commit-message-style.md`

Committing is not this skill's job. The invoking `/commit` workflow decides
whether a returned message is committed, and it is the only thing that runs
`git commit`.

## Input

A mode (`regular` or `bypass`) and optional commit context, in free-form prose.

The mode is supplied by the workflow from an explicit user-supplied token.
Never infer it, and never switch modes mid-analysis.

Commit context refines wording only. The staged diff decides what the change
is; context never overrides staged truth, and never adds a claim the diff does
not support.

Do not accept an unstaged diff, a working-tree summary, or a conversational
description as a substitute for the staged diff.

## Workflow

### 1. Read the staged diff

Read the staged changes with `git diff --cached`, and the staged file list with
`git diff --cached --name-status`.

Read staged file contents only when the diff alone does not explain the change.

Return `blocked` when nothing is staged.

### 2. Identify coherent units

Infer the main reason for the staged change from the diff first.

A coherent unit is one goal a reviewer would accept as a single commit. Group
staged files by that goal, not by directory.

In `bypass` mode, stop grouping here: the result is exactly one message
covering all staged files, whether or not the diff is coherent. Do not propose
splits, and do not report split guidance.

### 3. Choose a scope for each unit

Use the smallest stable subsystem or module name recognizable in the repository.

When no such name applies, use the primary directory or package of the unit's
changes.

### 4. Write each message

Follow `references/commit-message-style.md` for the subject pattern, the body
rules, issue references, the plan-citation rule, and the anti-patterns.

### 5. Apply the plan-citation rule

When the unit's staged files include `context/plans/*.md`, cite the affected
plan slug and updated task IDs in the body.

When the staged plan diff does not expose the slug or task ID clearly enough to
cite faithfully:

- In `regular` mode, return `blocked` and ask for the reference to be stated or
  staged explicitly.
- In `bypass` mode, infer the citation when the diff supports it, and otherwise
  omit it. Never stop, and never invent a slug or task ID.

### 6. Apply context-file guidance gating

This step applies in `regular` mode only. Skip it entirely in `bypass` mode; do
not classify staged scope there.

Classify the staged diff:

- Context-only (`context/**`): context-file-focused guidance is allowed.
- Mixed (`context/**` plus non-`context/**`): suppress default context-file
  commit reminders and give guidance that reflects the full staged scope.

### 7. Propose split guidance

This step applies in `regular` mode only.

When the units found in step 2 pursue unrelated goals, return one message per
unit, and state why the split is recommended and which staged files belong to
each.

When the staged changes form one unit, return one message and no split
guidance. Do not split coherent work to appear thorough.

### 8. Validate the result

Confirm before returning that:

- Every message describes its unit faithfully and covers only that unit's files.
- Every staged file belongs to exactly one returned message.
- No plan slug or task ID appears that the staged diff does not support.
- The mode's own constraints hold.

## Bypass execution handoff

This phase returns the message; the invoking `/commit` workflow performs the
bypass commit. When the mode is `bypass`, the invoking workflow must:

1. Create the commit-message temp file outside the repository working tree,
   and write the returned `message` verbatim to it using a file-writing
   operation. Never interpolate a multiline message into shell source or a
   shell command.
2. Run `git commit -F <message-file>` exactly once.
3. After and only after a successful commit, run
   `git rev-parse --verify HEAD^{commit}` and use that explicit `HEAD` value as
   the reported hash. Never parse Git's human-readable commit output.
4. On any commit failure, report Git's failure and stop. Never retry, amend,
   stage more files, or fabricate a hash.
5. Delete the temp file after the commit attempt, including on failure, where
   practical.

`oneshot` and `skip` select this same bypass behavior; they differ only in the
trigger token.

## Atomic commit boundaries

Do not:

- Run `git commit`, or any command that writes to the repository or its index.
- Stage, unstage, restore, or otherwise modify repository or worktree files.
  The bypass commit-message temp file is the sole exception: it must live
  outside the working tree, so it is not a repository or worktree file.
- Ask the user to stage or confirm staging.
- Analyze unstaged or untracked changes.
- Return more than one message in `bypass` mode.
- Return split guidance in `bypass` mode.
- Stop for plan-citation ambiguity in `bypass` mode.
- Invent plan slugs, task IDs, or issue references.
- Mention `context/` synchronization activity in a commit message.
- Claim a message was committed.
- Run plan, task, or validation workflows.


## Completion

The skill is complete after:

- The staged diff was read, or reading it failed and was reported.
- Messages were written for every staged file, or a blocker prevented it.
