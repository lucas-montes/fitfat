# SCE Decision

## Purpose

Write exactly one architecture decision record for one qualifying system-wide
important decision during successful task context synchronization. Return
a deterministic internal handoff to the invoking synchronization phase. Do not
render an independent user-visible response.

## Input

Accept one structured decision request from `sce-next-task` task context
synchronization. It must identify:

- One decision stated as a single durable choice.
- Why it qualifies under the decision gate.
- The implementation / task-verification evidence establishing the decision.
- The resolved plan path and relevant task IDs, when applicable.
- Related current-state context and existing ADR paths.
- An optional requested status.

Do not accept raw workflow arguments, ordinary phase state, multiple decisions,
or direct user invocation. Do not reconstruct missing material facts.

## Decision gate

A decision qualifies only when it establishes or changes a system-wide important
constraint involving at least one of:

- System boundaries or ownership.
- Public or cross-domain interfaces.
- Data models or persistence.
- Compatibility contracts.
- Security posture.
- Deployment or distribution strategy.
- A major dependency.
- A similarly durable constraint that is costly or risky to reverse.

Routine implementation details, local refactors, naming and formatting choices,
temporary experiments, and easily reversible choices do not qualify. When the
request does not demonstrate the threshold, return `not_qualified` (or
`skipped` when the caller deliberately skips the gate); do not create an ADR
merely because context synchronization occurred. A nonqualifying or skipped
result is non-blocking, so the invoking synchronization phase continues
normally. Reserve `blocked` for missing, contradictory, or otherwise unsafe
decision input or history.

## Workflow

### 1. Validate one decision

Confirm the request contains exactly one decision, qualifying evidence, a plan
path, references sufficient to make the record traceable, and no unresolved
material contradiction. If it contains several decisions, require the caller to
submit one request per decision.

Allowed statuses for a newly written ADR are exactly `Proposed`, `Accepted`,
`Rejected`, `Deprecated`, and `Superseded`. Use the explicitly requested allowed
status; otherwise default to `Accepted`. `Deprecated` and `Superseded` remain
distinct creation-time-only statuses: use them to describe the record when it is
created, but never mutate an existing ADR into or out of either status. Reject any
other status rather than guessing.

### 2. Inspect existing decision history

Read `context/decisions/` and the supplied related ADR paths before writing.

- Reuse an existing ADR only when it records an equivalent decision and has an
  active status: `Proposed` or `Accepted`. Return its path without creating a
  duplicate. Never reuse a `Rejected`, `Deprecated`, or `Superseded` ADR.
- Existing ADRs are immutable regardless of status. Never edit an ADR whose status is `Accepted`; do not edit, overwrite, or silently change the status of any existing record.
- A correction, reversal, or any changed decision always creates a new dated ADR;
  it references and supersedes the prior record when applicable, rather than
  modifying that record.

If `context/` or `context/decisions/` is absent, or history cannot be interpreted
without inventing facts, return `blocked` without creating directories.

### 3. Resolve the path

Use exactly `context/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<decision-slug>.md`, where the date is
the record creation date and `<decision-slug>` is a concise lowercase kebab-case
summary of the one decision. Resolve collisions by choosing a more specific
deterministic slug; never add an arbitrary counter and never overwrite a record.

### 4. Write the ADR

Create exactly one file using `references/adr-template.md` and these rules:

- **Context** states the forces and constraint that made a decision necessary.
- **Decision** states one resulting choice, not a list of unrelated choices.
- **Rationale** explains why this path best satisfies the constraints.
- **Alternatives considered** names credible alternatives and why they were not
  selected.
- **Compatibility and risks** states compatibility effects, migration concerns,
  and material risks with mitigations.
- **Guardrails** records durable limits that keep the decision narrow.
- **Consequences** records positive and negative resulting constraints.
- **Follow-up** lists only established work or conditions; use `None.` when no
  follow-up is established.
- **References** links the plan, relevant tasks, evidence, current-state context,
  related ADRs, and any superseded ADR.

Use repository-relative Markdown links where practical. Describe durable truth,
not the implementation session. Do not edit current-state context; the invoking
synchronization phase owns linking the new ADR from authoritative context.

### 5. Verify the record

Confirm that exactly one ADR was created or one existing matching ADR was reused;
the filename, status, sections, and references satisfy this contract; every
referenced repository path exists when practical to check; and no accepted ADR
was modified.

### 6. Return internal state

Return exactly one internal handoff:

- `written`: include `status`, `adr_path`, `decision`, `decision_status`,
  `created` (`true` for a new ADR and `false` for reuse), `supersedes`, and
  concise verification evidence.
- `not_qualified` or `skipped`: include `status`, the reason the decision gate
  did not produce an ADR, and concise supporting evidence. These results are
  non-blocking; the invoking synchronization phase continues normally.
- `blocked`: include `status`, the specific `problem`, its `impact`, and the
  `required_action`. Use this only when decision writing cannot proceed safely.

Use stable field names and repository-relative paths. Return no prose before or
after the handoff. The invoking synchronization phase owns all user-visible
reporting.

## Boundaries

Do not:

- Write more than one ADR per request.
- Run outside successful task context synchronization.
- Create a command, prompt, context root, or decisions directory.
- Modify application code, tests, plans, current-state context, or existing
  accepted ADRs.
- Treat every context update as an architecture decision.
- Choose among unresolved material alternatives on the user's behalf.
- Create a Git commit or push changes.
